## 📕 User Story

``````
for a new project Refer to the Good README guide. // SO THAT I can easily put together a good README // AS A developer I WANT a README generator
`````

## 💼 Business Context

````
When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
